# dockerized-stock-pipeline
A scalable and automated data pipeline built with Airflow (or Dagster) that fetches stock market data from the Alpha Vantage API, parses and processes the data, and updates a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline is fully Dockerized, configurable via environment variables, includes error handling, and is designed for easy scaling and monitoring.
